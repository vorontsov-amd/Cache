# LFU Cache
This is LFU algorithm cache working for O(1). 
It also implements an "ideal cache" and shows a comparison between an ideal cache and an LFC cache.
##### Compilling
To compile a program to compare caches with runtime counts, use make with the test argument.
```cmd
make test
```
In order to compile test for LFC cache use make without arguments
```cmd
make
```
##### Test results for 10,000 cells and a capacity of 10
